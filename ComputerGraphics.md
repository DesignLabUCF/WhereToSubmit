# Computer Graphics

Computer graphics is an art of drawing pictures, lines, charts, etc using computers with the help of programming. The term computer graphics includes almost everything on computers that is not text or sound. Today almost every computer can do some graphics, and people have even come to expect to control their computer through icons and pictures rather than just by typing.

One of the best sources to track *what is what* in *Computer Graphics* is [**Ke-Sen Huang's Paper Tracking page**](http://kesen.realtimerendering.com/) one of the best all around paper resources in any field.
